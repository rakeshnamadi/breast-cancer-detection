# breast-cancer-detection
Using a Dataset Breast Cancer from kaggle, a machine learning model can helps to detect the cells of breast cancer whether it is a malignant or Benign.

Download a dataset from kaggle and find the code from main.py
I used logistic regression to predict the cancer cells
Here the dataset contain 33 clomuns and here diagnosis column contains two unique values M- malignant and B- Benign. This column is used as dependent varible for prediction in this model.
By using logistic regression this model trained and tested with 98.8% accuracy.
